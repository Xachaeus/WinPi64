# WinPi64
 ARM64 Raspberry Pi emulator using QEMU for Windows.

## How to install
Within the repository, select the version and package you would like to download (it is NOT RECOMMENDED that you download the entire repository, as each package version is upwards of a gigabyte in size).
Download the pre-compressed zip file, extract it into a folder of your choosing, and execute the run.bat script. 
If you would like to be able to run the emulator from your desktop without needing to open anything in the file explorer, simply create a shortcut for the run.bat script and add it to your desktop.
