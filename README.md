# WinPi64
 ARM64 Raspberry Pi emulator using QEMU for Windows.

## How to install
Please not that the uncompressed emulator requires about 8.5 GB for the Raspberry Pi OS image and the emulator files.

#### (NOTE: Presently, the .zip package cannot be downloaded from the repository directly; please download from the release linked below.)

Within the repository, find the version and package you would like to download (it is NOT RECOMMENDED that you download the entire repository, as each .zip package is upwards of a gigabyte in size).
Download the pre-compressed .zip file (you can do this by selecting the file and then selecting "Download Raw File"), extract it into a folder of your choosing, and execute the run.bat script. 

Alternatively, you can also download the most recent .zip package from the latest release on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Xachaeus/WinPi64/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta).

If you would like to be able to run the emulator from your desktop without needing to open anything in the file explorer, simply create a shortcut for the run.bat script and add it to your desktop.
